We found [this file](https://tamuctf.com/5d6b407ee061e8696136d4dfd25f24b0/static/deleted.zip) and were told that it contains a flag within it. Can you find the flag?

## Solution

Download the file from the link and then put it into Autopsy. Once you go to the deleted files section or Unalloc section, you can click through the files to find a `zzooo.png` file to see the flag.
