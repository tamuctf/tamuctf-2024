# Lost Tourist

Author: `kit`

I'm playing hide and seek with a friend, and I am the seeker. I received a hint from a friend about their whereabouts, can you find out where my friend is?

Note: flag format will be `gigem{name_of_location}`. Additionally, the location is where the picture was taken from.

## Solution

I was able to use Google Lens to identify the white building in the background of the image. This building is the The Esplanade in Singapore. I found this building in Google Maps and was able to easily see which direction the picture was taken from, and found the bridge name to be the Helix Bridge.

Flag: `gigem{helix_bridge}`
